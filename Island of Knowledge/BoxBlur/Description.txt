The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 × 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.

Example

For

image = [[1, 1, 1], 
         [1, 7, 1], 
         [1, 1, 1]]
the output should be boxBlur(image) = [[1]].
